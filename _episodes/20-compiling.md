## What Is A Compiled Language

A **compiled language** is one which requires a program called a compiler to
convert human readable instructions into **machine code** that the 
computer can directly understand. Some popular compiled languages are
`C`, `C++`, and `FORTRAN`.

Once the program source code is compiled once, it doesn't need to
be compiled again -- the computer can very quickly load up the program
and run the instructions as many times as we would like it to.

There is another type of programming language called an **interpreted language**.
With these languages, there is a program called an interpreter that loads
and executes the source code of the program **everytime you run it**
(usually one line at a time). Examples of popular interpreted languages are
`Python`, `Javascript` and `Ruby`.


## Why Use A Compiled Language?

The one obvious reason is speed -- the machine code generated by a
compiler runs a lot faster than source code that needs to be fed
into an interpreter at run time, one line at a time.

Compiled languages also allow for tighter, more efficient memory management. You can create for your program exactly as much memory as you need. But you also have the power to shoot yourself in the foot -- you also much clean up the memory you create to be efficient (but you don't have to worry about cleaning it up when the program ends, the operating system will do this for you.) 

Compilers can (often automatically) optimize the machine code generated to access special instructions of the chip you are running on to make your code run even faster. They can even reorder and rethink pieces of code to manage memory more efficiently.

## Why Not Use A Compiled Language?

Compiled languages are harder to program, mostly due to the memory management required. For example, you will need to define the type of every variable you declare (e.g. character, integer, floating-point number). With most interpreted languages, you usually don't have to worry about this.

Machine code generated by a compiler on one system is not guaranteed to run on another computer -- the CPU chip features will sometimes be different between systems, so the compiled code won't run. Even source code may been to be altered between different operating systems/CPU architectures/compilers. In general, interpreted code is very portable, and just runs the same on different systems.

## Setting up the environment to compile programs

The Intel compiler is licensed on all of the Compute Canada clusters, and
it is the preferred compiler to use. This is because Intel designed the
CPU chips in our cluster, so their compilers will create better
optimized code to run on these chips.

We do not have a license for the Intel
Compiler on our training cluster, so we need to use the free compiler `gcc`.
In order to use the compiler, we need to load into our work environment:

```
module load gcc
```
{: .bash}

## Compiling our first C program

Now that we have a compiler loaded, lets compile a simple C program

```
gcc -o hello hello.c
```
{: .bash}

Note: on a cluster with the Intel compiler installed, we could compile the same program using:

```
icc -o hello hello.c
```
{: .bash}

## Running our compiled C program

We can run the program with:

```
./hello
```
{: .bash}

Notice that we didn't just type `hello` to run our new program. Here that the dot (`.`) at the beginning of the command refers to the current directory we are in, and tells our shell where to find the `hello` program. If we did not do this, the shell may not be able to find our program, or it could even find a different hello program and run that instead. For example, in the standard path `/usr/bin`, if there is a command called `hello`.

## Compiling and running a FORTRAN program

Compiling FORTRAN code is very similar:

```
gfortran -o hello_fortran hello.f90
```
{: .bash}

Run the compiled fortran program with:
```
./hello_fortran
```
{: .bash}

Note: the `-o` flag tells the compiler where to output the compiled machine code. If you exclude the `-o` flag, the machine code will be writen to a file called `a.out`. This compiled program can be run with:

```
./a.out
```
{: .bash}

Note: as programs get more complex, it often makes sense to break up
programs into multiple source files. These files will need to be linked
together into a running program. At this point, it makes sense to use a
`Makefile` (or some other build system) to manage the compiling and
linking of your program.
